👋 Hi, I’m @kato-el

👀 I’m interested in meeting a dwarf unicorn (because regular unicorns are just too mainstream)

🌱 I’m currently learning something that I'm really good at (so technically, I’m just getting even better)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some... thing (mystery makes it exciting, right?)

📫 How to reach me ... (carrier pigeon preferred, but I'll accept emails if they come with memes)

😄 Pronouns: ... (classified information, top secret 🕵️‍♂️)

⚡ Fun fact: ... I once met a dwarf unicorn... or maybe it was just a goat with a party hat 🎉
